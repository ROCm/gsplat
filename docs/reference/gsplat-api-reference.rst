  - **opacities** – The opacities of the Gaussians. […, N]

  - **colors** – The colors of the Gaussians. […, (C,) N, D] or […, (C,)
    N, K, 3] for SH coefficients.

  - **viewmats** – The world-to-cam transformation of the cameras. […,
    C, 4, 4]

  - **Ks** – The camera intrinsics. […, C, 3, 3]

  - **far_plane** – The far plane for clipping. Default is 1e10.

  - **radius_clip** – Gaussians with 2D radius smaller or equal than
    this value will be skipped. This is extremely helpful for speeding
    up large scale scenes. Default is 0.0.

  - **eps2d** – An epsilon added to the egienvalues of projected 2D
    covariance matrices. This will prevents the projected GS to be too
    small. For example eps2d=0.3 leads to minimal 3 pixel unit. Default
    is 0.3.

  - **sh_degree** – The SH degree to use, which can be smaller than the
    total number of bands. If set, the colors should be […, (C,) N, K,
    3] SH coefficients, else the colors should be […, (C,) N, D]
    post-activation color values. Default is None.

  - **packed** – Whether to use packed mode which is more memory
    efficient but might or might not be as fast. Default is True.

  - **tile_size** – The size of the tiles for rasterization. Default is
    16. (Note: other values are not tested)

    “pinhole”, “ortho”, “fisheye”, and “ftheta”. Default is “pinhole”.

  - **segmented** – Whether to use segmented radix sort. Default is
    False. Segmented radix sort performs sorting in segments, which is

  - **radial_coeffs** – Opencv pinhole/fisheye radial distortion
    coefficients. Default is None. For pinhole camera, the shape should
    be […, C, 6]. For fisheye camera, the shape should be […, C, 4].

  - **tangential_coeffs** – Opencv pinhole tangential distortion
    coefficients. Default is None. The shape should be […, C, 2] if
    provided.

  - **thin_prism_coeffs** – Opencv pinhole thin prism distortion

Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  This function is currently not differentiable with regard to the camera
    intrinsics Ks.

2.  **Multi-GPU Distributed Rasterization**: This function can be used
    in a multi-GPU distributed scenario by setting distributed to True.
    When distributed is True, a subset of total Gaussians could be
    passed into this function in each rank, and the function will
    collaboratively render a set of images using Gaussians from all
    ranks. Note to achieve balanced computation, it is recommended (not
    enforced) to have similar number of Gaussians in each rank. But it
    is enforced that the number of cameras to be rendered in each rank is
    the same. The function will return the rendered images corresponds
    to the input cameras in each rank, and allows for gradients to flow
    back to the Gaussians living in other ranks. For the details, please
    refer to the paper `On Scaling Up 3D Gaussian Splatting
    Training <https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18533>`__.

3.  **Batch Rasterization**: This function allows for rasterizing a set
    of 3D Gaussians to a batch of images in one go, by simplly providing
    the batched viewmats and Ks.

4.  **Support N-D Features**: If sh_degree is None, the colors is
    expected to be with shape […, N, D] or […, C, N, D], in which D is
    the channel of the features to be rendered. The computation is slow
    when D > 32 at the moment. If sh_degree is set, the colors is
    expected to be the SH coefficients with shape […, N, K, 3] or […, C,
    N, K, 3], where K is the number of SH bases.

5.  **Depth Rendering**: This function supports colors or/and depths via
    render_mode. The supported modes are “RGB”, “D”, “ED”, “RGB+D”, and
    “RGB+ED”. “RGB” renders the colored image that respects the colors
    argument. “D” renders the accumulated z-depth “ED” renders the expected z-depth.
    “RGB+D” and “RGB+ED” render both the colored image and the depth,
    in which the depth is the last channel of the output.

6.  **Memory-Speed Trade-off**: The packed argument provides a trade-off
    between memory footprint and runtime. If packed is True, the
    intermediate results are packed into sparse tensors, which is more
    memory efficient but might be slightly slower. This is especially
    helpful when the scene is large and each camera sees only a small
    portion of the scene. If packed is False, the intermediate results
    are with shape […, C, N, …], which is faster but might consume more
    memory.

7.  **Sparse Gradients**: If sparse_grad is True, the gradients for
    {means, quats, scales} will be stored in a `COO sparse
    layout <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.sparse_coo_tensor.html>`__.
    This can be helpful for saving memory for training when the scene is
    large and each iteration only activates a small portion of the
    Gaussians. Usually a sparse optimizer is required to work with
    sparse gradients, such as
    `torch.optim.SparseAdam <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SparseAdam.html#sparseadam>`__.
    This argument is only effective when packed is True.

8.  **Speed-up for Large Scenes**: The radius_clip argument is extremely
    helpful for speeding up large scale scenes or scenes with large
    depth of fields. Gaussians with 2D radius smaller or equal than this
    value (in pixel unit) will be skipped during rasterization. This
    will skip all the far-away Gaussians that are too small to be seen
    in the image. But be warned that if there are close-up Gaussians
    that are also below this threshold, they will also get skipped
    (which is rarely happened in practice). This is by default disabled
    by setting radius_clip to 0.0.

9.  **Antialiased Rendering**: If rasterize_mode is “antialiased”, the
    function will apply a view-dependent compensation factor to Gaussian
    opacities, where is the projected 2D covariance matrix and is the
    eps2d. This will make the rendered image more antialiased, as
    proposed in the paper `Mip-Splatting: Alias-free 3D Gaussian
    Splatting <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16493>`__.

10. **AbsGrad**: If absgrad is True, the absolute gradients of the
    projected 2D means will be computed during the backward pass, which
    could be accessed by meta[“means2d”].absgrad. This is an
    implementation of the paper `AbsGS: Recovering Fine Details for 3D
    Gaussian Splatting <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10484>`__, which is
    shown to be more effective for splitting Gaussians during training.

11. **Camera Distortion and Rolling Shutter**: The function supports
    rendering with opencv distortion formula for pinhole and fisheye
    cameras (radial_coeffs, tangential_coeffs, thin_prism_coeffs). It
    also supports rolling shutter rendering with the rolling_shutter
    argument. This is referenced from the paper `3DGUT: Enabling
    Distorted Cameras and Secondary Rays in Gaussian
    Splatting <https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12507>`__.

.. _densification-1:

Densification
===================================================================

In gsplat, you can abstract out the densification and pruning process of the
Gaussian training into a strategy. A strategy is a class that defines
how the Gaussian parameters (along with their optimizers) should be
updated (splitting, pruning, etc.) during the training.

.. _dens-default-strategy:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    class DefaultStrategy(
        prune_opa: float = 0.005, grow_grad2d: float = 0.0002,

        refine_stop_iter: int = 15000, reset_every: int = 3000,
        refine_every: int = 100, pause_refine_after_reset: int = 0,

  - **grow_scale2d**
    (`float <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float>`__)
    – GSs with 2D scale (normalized by image resolution) above this
    value will be split. Default is 0.05.

  - **prune_scale3d**
    (`float <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float>`__)
    – GSs with 3d scale (normalized by scene_scale) above this value
    will be pruned. Default is 0.1.

  - **prune_scale2d**
    (`float <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float>`__)
    – GSs with 2d scale (normalized by image resolution) above this
    value will be pruned. Default is 0.15.

    gradient and 2DGS uses a similar gradient which stores in variable
    “gradient_2dgs”.

.. _dens-strategy-notes:

Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If absgrad=True, it will use the absolute gradients instead of
   average gradients for GS duplicating & splitting, following the AbsGS
   paper `AbsGS: Recovering Fine Details for 3D Gaussian
   Splatting <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10484>`__. Which typically
   leads to better results but requires to set the grow_grad2d to a
   higher value, e.g., 0.0008. Also, the rasterization() function should
   be called with absgrad=True as well so that the absolute gradients
   are computed.

.. _mcmc-strategy:

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy
------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    class MCMCStrategy(
        cap_max: int = 1_000_000, noise_lr: float = 5e5,
        refine_start_iter: int = 500, refine_stop_iter: int = 25000,
        refine_every: int = 100, min_opacity: float = 0.005,
        verbose: bool = False
    )

Strategy that follows the paper:

`3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte
Carlo <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591>`__

This strategy will:

- Periodically teleport GSs with low opacity to a place that has high
  opacity.

- Periodically introduce new GSs sampled based on the opacity
  distribution.

- Periodically perturb the GSs locations.

**Parameters**:

- **cap_max**
  (`int <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int>`__) –

Notes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. During projection, the Gaussians that are outside of the camera
   frustum are ignored. So not all the elements in the output tensors are
   valid. The output radii could serve as an indicator, in which zero
   radii means the corresponding elements are invalid in the output
   tensors and will be ignored in the next rasterization process. If
   packed=True, the output tensors will be packed into a flattened
   tensor, in which all elements are valid. In this case, a
   ``batch_ids`` tensor and ``camera_ids`` tensor will be returned to indicate the batch,
   camera and gaussian indices of the packed flattened tensor, which is
   essentially following the COO sparse tensor format.

2. This functions supports projecting Gaussians with either covariances
   or {quaternions, scales}, which will be converted to covariances
   internally in a fused CUDA kernel. Either covars or {quats, scales}
   should be provided.

Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. This function exposes the alpha compositing process into pure
   Pytorch. So it relies on Pytorch’s autograd for the backpropagation.
   It is much slower than our fully fused rasterization implementation
   and comsumes much more GPU memory. But it could serve as a playground
   for new ideas or debugging, as no backward implementation is needed.

2. This function requires the nerfacc package to be installed.

- **Function**: Rasterizes a batch of Gaussians to images but only returns the
  indices. This function supports iterative rasterization, in which each
  call of this function will rasterize a batch of Gaussians from near to
  far, defined by [range_start, range_end). If a one-step full
  rasterization is desired, set range_start to 0 and range_end to a
  really large number, e.g, 1e10.

- **Returns**:

  - **Gaussian ids**. Gaussian ids for the pixel intersection. A
    flattened list of shape [M].

  - **Pixel ids**. pixel indices (row-major). A flattened list of shape
    [M].

  - **Camera ids**. Camera indices. A flattened list of shape [M].

  - **Batch ids**. Batch indices. A flattened list of shape [M].

- **Return type**: tuple

- **Parameters**:

  - **range_start** – The start batch of Gaussians to be rasterized
    (inclusive).

  - **range_end** – The end batch of Gaussians to be rasterized
    (exclusive).

  - **transmittances** – Currently transmittances. […, image_height,
    image_width]

  - **means2d** – Projected Gaussian means. […, N, 2]

  - **ray_transforms** – transformation matrices that transforms
    xy-planes in pixel spaces into splat coordinates. […, N, 3, 3]

  - **opacities** – Gaussian opacities that support per-view values. […,
    N]

  - **image_width** – Image width.

  - **image_height** – Image height.

  - **tile_size** – Tile size.

  - **isect_offsets** – Intersection offsets outputs from
    isect_offset_encode(). […, tile_height, tile_width]

  - **flatten_ids** – The global flatten indices in [I \* N] from
    isect_tiles(). [n_isects]
