# gsplat for ROCm

gsplat is an open-source library for GPU  accelerated rasterization of gaussians with python bindings. It is inspired by the SIGGRAPH paper [3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).

This repo is the HIP port of the gsplat repo which is enabled and optimised for RCOM runing on AMD Instinct processors. 

## System Requirements
GSPLAT  for AMD ROCm™ 1.0.0 depends directly on NumPy and PyTorch for AMD ROCm™ with many optional dependencies

- OS : Ubuntu 22.04 and above
- ROCM Versions 6.4.1 and above
- GPU Platforms : MI300X
- Pytorch: 2.6 and above
- Python : 3.12 and above.
  
## Installation

 - Install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) first. The easiet way is the use the official docker image which has pytorch for ROCm.

    ```bash
    docker run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --ipc=host --privileged=true   --shm-size=128GB --network=host --device=/dev/kfd  --device=/dev/dri --group-add video -it   -v $HOME:$HOME --name rocm_pytorch rocm/pytorch:latest 
    ```
 
- Install the gsplat from the AMD hosted PYPI repoitory.

    ```bash
    pip install gsplat --extra-index-url=https://pypi.amd.com/simple
    ```
- Once the installation is sucessful, you can verify the installation using the pip show command
  ```bash
    pip show gsplat
  ```

## Examples

We provide a set of examples to get you started! Below you can find the details about the examples 

- Get the examples folder from the github repo
  ```bash
  git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/rocm/gsplat.git && cd gsplat && git sparse-checkout init --cone
  git sparse-checkout add examples && git checkout main
  ```
- Install the dependencies and download the test data set
   ```bash 
   cd examples
   pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
   python datasets/download_dataset.py
  ```
- To run the examples refer to the docs below.

## Evaluation

This repo comes with a standalone script that reproduces the official Gaussian Splatting with exactly the same performance on PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and converged number of Gaussians. Powered by gsplat’s efficient GPU implementation, the training takes up to **4x less GPU memory** with up to **15% less time** to finish than the official implementation. Full report can be found [here](https://amd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DCGPUAIST/pages/1115965044/Evaluation+Results+on+MI300).
